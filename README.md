# pletho
An advertising comparison platform, built using an array of different languages, making use of a Parse Cloud Database and the Stripe Payment Platform.

Pletho has been built as a minimum viable product for a client who required it to woo potential investors. The MVP works using several platforms: Vimeo for television adverts; Soundcloud for radio advertisements and the payment platform used was Stripe (configured to take a service fee on all transactions between an Advertiser and a Publisher automatically).

The MVP also contained a simple admin suite that allowed members of Pletho's staff to interact on any order, acting as a mediator when a dispute occured. 
Orders passed through several stages before payment and completion. At each stage security and validty checks were made to ensure that the Publishers were who they said they were and that payments made by an Advertiser were clear and confirmed before their order automatically progressed.
