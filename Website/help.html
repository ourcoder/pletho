<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>The Advertiser Page</i>
<hr/>
<img class="desktop" src="/images/help/advertiserhelp1.jpg" style="max-width:730px;max-height:323px;width:100%;height:auto;" />
<img class="mobile" src="/images/mobile/advertiserhelp1m.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:142px;width:100%;height:auto;" />
</div><br/>
<b style="color:silver;">1.</b>	As a new advertiser on the Pletho platform it is best to start on the Advertiser page. This is the advertiser homepage, where you can search for advert listings posted by Pletho’s publishers. <br/><br/>

<b style="color:black;">2.</b>	At the top of the page (below the menu) you have a search bar; in this bar you can type any search text or keyword that you think would relate to the advert you are looking for; for example: “#TV #Manchester”.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:orange;">3.</b>	To submit your search, just click the button labelled ‘Search’ on the right (displayed as an arrow on smartphones) or press enter on your keyboard. <br/><br/>

<b style="color:green;">4.</b>	The ‘Show All’ button displays all adverts currently available to purchase on the Pletho Marketplace.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:gold;">5.</b>	The button marked ‘Advanced’ will display a new panel where Advertisers can search for campaigns that fit a very specific criteria.<br/><br/>
<hr/>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>The Advanced Search Panel</i><a name="Help:Advertiser:AdvancedSearch" id="Help:Advertiser:AdvancedSearch"></a>
<hr/>
<img class="desktop" src="/images/help/advertiserhelp2.jpg" style="max-width:637px;max-height:223px;width:100%;height:auto;" />
<img class="mobile" src="/images/mobile/advertiserhelp2m.jpg" style="max-width:350px;max-height:123px;width:100%;height:auto;" />
</div><br/>
<b style="color:gold;">1.</b>	The first advanced search setting available is the locality. Here you can choose to restrict the results to show only Local or National adverts.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:silver;">2.</b>	The Budget bar allows you to set minimum and maximum budget value, restricting the resulting adverts to only those that fall between these values.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:orange;">3.</b>	The Lead bar also features a minimum and maximum value choice. This will restrict returning results to those that fall within the specific hours chosen.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:green;">4.</b>	There are four drop down lists that appear in the middle of the advanced search panel. These are; Country, City, Campaign Length and Publisher. These drop down lists feature only the countries, cities, campaign lengths and publishers that have adverts for sale right now. Choosing an option in any of these drop down list will restrict the results to that chosen option.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:darkgrey;">5.</b>	The last option on the advanced search panel is the advert types; Billboard, Bus, Cinema, Magazine, Newspaper, Radio, TV and Taxi. These are also populated from adverts that are currently for sale on the Pletho platform. You can choose one or many options here to restrict your search results to only those that are of this advert type.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:red;">6.</b>	The advanced search panel allows users to save advanced search criteria to load back at a later date. First choose the search criteria you would like to remember and then hit ‘Save’. If you then ‘Reset’ the advanced search panel and hit ‘Load’, Pletho will automatically load the previously saved advanced search options you provided earlier. <br/><br/>
<hr/>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>Search Results</i><a name="Help:Advertiser:SearchResults" id="Help:Advertiser:SearchResults"></a>
<hr/>
<img class="desktop" src="/images/help/advertiserhelp3.jpg" style="max-width:675px;max-height:569px;width:100%;height:auto;" />
<img class="mobile" src="/images/mobile/advertiserhelp3m.jpg" style="max-width:350px;max-height:295px;width:100%;height:auto;" />
</div><br/>
<b style="color:black;">1.</b>	From our search; “#Manchester #TV” we have returned three matching results. The result marked as ‘1’ in the image is in a detailed view, this was achieved by clicking on the advert once.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:darkgrey;">2.</b>	The advert marked as ‘2’ is in minimal view. All adverts return in this view mode by default, you will only see detailed information when you click on an advert.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:darkgreen;">3.</b>	Advert ‘3’ has been clicked twice. This has put the advert in the highlighted state. When an advert is in this state the two buttons; ‘Buy’ and ‘Share’ become active. If this advert is clicked again it will return back to its minimal view (as seen in ‘2’). <br/><br/>

<b style="color:lightgreen;">4.</b>	As we can see from this example, three of a maximum of twelve adverts are being displayed. Nine adverts did not match our search criteria and therefor were not displayed in the results.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:orange;">5.</b>	When an advert has been highlighted (advert ‘3’), the ‘Share’ button becomes active. This button allows you to share information that pertains to this specific advert. Several sharing options are available, including popular social networks and email; allowing you to share adverts directly with colleagues, friends or family in just a couple of clicks.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:red;">6.</b>	The ‘Buy’ button works the same as the ‘Share’ button; in that it only becomes active when an advert has been highlighted. Only one advert can be highlighted at any one time.<br/><br/>
<hr/>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>Buying / Purchasing / Ordering</i><a name="Help:Advertiser:Buying" id="Help:Advertiser:Buying"></a>
<hr/>
<img src="/images/help/advertiserhelp4.jpg" style="max-width:297px;max-height:213px;width:100%;height:auto;" /></div><br/>
<b style="color:black;">1.</b>	After you have clicked the ‘Buy’ button you will be greeted with a small panel to input specific details about your campaign. The first is the ‘Preferred Date’ that you would like the advert to air. To choose a date simply tap where it says ‘Tap to pick’ and a calendar will appear.
Please note: at the top of the page information regarding the earliest date and time the campaign can be ordered for will appear. Ordering before this date is not be possible.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:lightgreen;">2.</b>	The ‘Preferred Time’ option will only appear for specific advert types that require it. To choose a time simply click the text “Tap to choose” and then pick the time that best fits your campaign.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:blue;">3.</b>	Please enter the amount of ‘Flexibility’ you would like your campaign to have. This will help the Publisher when they set an exact date and time that your advert will air. You can set the ‘Flexibility’ as minutes, hours, days, weeks, none or open (if you are unsure).<br/><br/>

<b style="color:orange;">4.</b>	The ‘Advert Url’ field requires an internet address that points to the advert you want the Publisher to display. <br/>
<i>For example;</i><br/><br/>
A TV advert would be a video, so would be hosted on Vimeo and have an internet address similar to: <a style="text-decoration:underline;word-break: normal;" href="http://vimeo.com/14504562" target="_blank">http://vimeo.com/14504562</a><br/><br/>
A Radio advert would be sound, so would be hosted on Soundcloud and have an internet address similar to: <a style="text-decoration:underline;word-break: normal;" href="https://soundcloud.com/slamminvinyl/westfest-radio-advert-2012-for" target="_blank">http://soundcloud.com/s/radio</a><br/><br/>
A Magazine advert would be an image, so would be hosted on Imgur and have an internet address similar to: <a style="text-decoration:underline;word-break: normal;" href="http://i.imgur.com/tiC9ufb.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/tiC9ufb.jpg</a><br/><br/>
Using Imgur you can even share an album of images with the Publisher.<br/><br/>
If you require more help getting your advert online, please scroll down to see the in-depth tutorials.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:darkgreen;">5.</b>	The default currency that loads with the advert is the one that the Publisher will require payment in. If you wish to see what the cost is in your own currency you can do so by using the currency drop down list. Please note that your bank may charge transaction and conversion fees when purchasing in foreign currencies.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:red;">6.</b>	Once you have entered all the details into the fields provided you can now click the ‘Buy’ text to forward your order on to the Publisher for approval. At any time during this process you can click the ‘X’ (cross) icon in the top right corner to exit and close the purchase window.<br/><br/>

<div style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline"><b>Vimeo Tutorial</b><a name="Help:Advertiser:Vimeo" id="Help:Advertiser:Vimeo"></a>
<hr/></div>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>Sign Up To Vimeo</i><hr/><img src="/images/vimeo/vimeo1.jpg" style="max-width:330px;max-height:327px;width:100%;height:auto;" />
</div><br />
    <b style="color:black;">1.</b>	The first step to uploading your video on to Vimeo requires you to sign up with the platform at: <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/</a><br/><br/>
    <b style="color:black;">2.</b>	Now that you have an account with Vimeo it is time to choose a package. There are three to choose from: Basic (Free), Plus and Pro. You can choose basic for now and upgrade at any point in the future if you need to.<br/><br/>
<hr/>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>Choose Your Video</i><hr/><img src="/images/vimeo/vimeo2.jpg" style="max-width:346px;max-height:111px;width:100%;height:auto;" />
  <img src="/images/vimeo/vimeo3.jpg" style="max-width:346px;max-height:111px;width:100%;height:auto;" /></div><br/>

<b style="color:black;">3.</b>	Now it is time to upload your video, tap the button named "Upload a video" and then proceed by clicking the button called "Choose a Video to Upload". Once you have chosen the video you would like the Publisher to use, click the "Upload Selected Videos" button. Please note: depending on the video size and your internet speed, this could take sometime. <br/><div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><img src="/images/vimeo/vimeo4.jpg" style="max-width:345px;max-height:111px;width:100%;height:auto;" /></div><br/>

<b style="color:black;">4.</b>	While your video is uploading you can add some additional information to your new Vimeo video, for example; a title, description, tags and a language. On the privacy page you have detailed options about how you wish your video to be shared. To make things easy for Publishers it is best to ensure "Anyone – Allow anyone to see this video" and "Download the video – Allow anyone to download this video" options are selected. Once your advert has been aired you can always come back and change these privacy settings.<br/><br/>
<hr/>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>Save Changes</i><hr/><img src="/images/vimeo/vimeo6.jpg" style="max-width:175px;max-height:61px;width:100%;height:auto;" /></div><br/>
<b style="color:black;">5.</b>	If you have modified the video listing information and settings click "Save Changes" so that Vimeo remembers the changed content.<br/><br/>
<hr/>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>View Video</i><hr/><img src="/images/vimeo/vimeo7.jpg" style="max-width:643px;max-height:77px;width:100%;height:auto;" /></div><br/>
<b style="color:black;">6.</b>	After your video has completed its upload process the uploading bar will change to a big green button labelled: "Done! Go to video" - click this to proceed to your video.<br/><br/>
<hr/>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><i>Waiting in line...</i><hr/><img src="/images/vimeo/vimeo8.jpg" style="max-width:858px;max-height:329px;width:100%;height:auto;" /></div><br/>
<b style="color:black;">7.</b>	Congratulations, you have uploaded your first video to Vimeo. It is likely that on this page you will be greeted by a message stating that you are "Waiting in line" for the video to be processed. What we need to do now is grab the address to this new video, make sure you have the "Waiting in line" page open and copy (CTRL + C) the internet address at the top of your browser window; it will look something like this: <br/><br/>
<div style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><img src="/images/vimeo/vimeo9.jpg" style="max-width:307px;max-height:48px;width:100%;height:auto;" /></div><br/>
<b style="color:black;">8.</b>	It is a good idea to bookmark this page, save the address in your notes/email or write it down on some paper. <b style="text-decoration:underline">Please do not submit an order with this address until the video has completed the processing stage</b>. Until processing is complete the Publisher will see a blank page, which could cause some confusion.<br/><br/><br/>

<b style="color:black;">3.</b>	While your audio file is uploading and processing you can add some additional information to your new Soundcloud upload, such as; a title, tags, a description, an image and metadata. <b>Do not forget</b> to also modify the '<em>Permissions</em>' setting '<em>Enable downloads</em>' - (circled in the above image); this is so that Publishers are able to download your advert for playback. You can turn this option off once your advert has been aired.<br/><br/>
